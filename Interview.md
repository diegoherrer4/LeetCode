How to explain the project:

Start by giving the shortest explanation of what the project was about, and the kind of team involved in creating it. Then, move on to which technologies you used to develop it. Finally, find something you liked about the project, and describe it.

There is a reason the word team is in bold letters. You probably didn’t work alone. Make sure you are making it obvious to the interviewer that you collaborated with other people, and how they were awesome at X, you were awesome at Y, and it ended up making the whole project better.

Example:

“I worked with a 6 person team (4 developers, 1 BA, 1 PM) on the new ACME corporation website, which was created to showcase their Mail Order catalogue.

My main role was backend development with PHP, Laravel 5 , MySQL, and AWS services. I was mostly working on the REST API and was in charge of integrating the OAuth 2.0 server into the project, but I collaborated on some specific frontend modules when needed, since I know some AngularJS and HTML as well.

The best part (technical, at least) about this project is that I got to learn a lot about ElasticSearch, which I was really curious about. We were able to deploy the first version in 4 months and then continued to improve upon it with feedback from the AB Testing and digital marketing team the client had.

Please feel free to ask any questions.”

This is pretty long, but it gets the point across and it could be said in a few minutes without boring the other person to death.

It shows that: you know a lot about this project, you know how to work with others, and you even feel comfortable moving around different roles when the shit hits the fan and you are needed. It even makes it simple for your interviewer to follow up with “How did you do X in Y technology” , since you mentioned many different parts of the website’s stack, and they can choose from that to ask you design patters, specific implementation questions, etc.

Why I used MUI?

Write less code: in situations where styled-components would be overkill, the sx prop can replace dozens of lines of code. Write the CSS you already know: the sx prop features a superset of CSS, so it's intuitive to pick up and start working with right away if you're comfortable with CSS.

Index.js file explanation:

/_ CONFIGURATIONS _/
const **filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const **dirname = path.dirname(\_\_filename);

dotenv.config();
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: "50mb", extended: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ limit: "50mb", extended: true }));
app.use(cors());
app.use(morgan("dev"));

The first two lines set up **filename and **dirname variables using Node.js' fileURLToPath and path.dirname methods respectively. These variables will later be used to reference the current file and directory.

The dotenv.config() method loads environment variables from a .env file in the root directory of the project. This is used to configure the application with sensitive information like database credentials.

const app = express() initializes an instance of the Express.js application framework, which is a popular web framework for Node.js.

app.use(express.json()) is middleware that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads, allowing them to be accessed as req.body.

app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: "50mb", extended: true })) and app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ limit: "50mb", extended: true })) set up body parsing middleware that allows incoming requests with large payloads to be handled properly.

app.use(cors()) sets up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware to allow resources on the server to be accessed from different domains.

app.use(morgan("dev")) sets up logging middleware using the morgan package, which logs HTTP requests to the console in the development environment.

const storage = multer.memoryStorage();
const upload = multer({ storage });

const storage = multer.memoryStorage() sets up storage middleware for handling files in memory instead of saving them to disk.

const upload = multer({ storage }) sets up file upload middleware using the multer package, which allows the server to handle file uploads.

/_ ROUTES WITH FILES _/
app.post("/auth/register", upload.single("picture"), register);
app.post("/post", verifyToken, upload.single("picture"), createPost);

/_ ROUTES _/
app.use("/auth", authRoutes);
app.use("/users", userRoutes);
app.use("/posts", postRoutes);

The first two routes (/auth/register and /post) are post routes that use the upload.single middleware to handle file uploads. They call the register and createPost functions respectively.

The remaining routes (/auth, /users, and /posts) are middleware that use the Express.js use method to include other route files with their own middleware and handlers. These route files are typically organized in a separate file for cleaner and more modular code.

/_ MONGOOSE SETUP _/

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 6001;
mongoose
.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL, {
useNewUrlParser: true,
useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
.then(() => {
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server Port: ${PORT}`));
})
.catch((error) => console.log(`${error} did not connect`));

This code sets up the Mongoose library for working with MongoDB databases. It also sets the server's port number to either the PORT environment variable or port 6001.

The mongoose.connect() method connects to the MongoDB database specified in the process.env.MONGO_URL environment variable.

If the connection is successful, the server is started using the app.listen() method, which
