Foreword
This is not a straightforward parenting book.
I’m not going to go into details about potty-training or weaning.
This book is about how we have relationships with our children, what gets
in the way of a good connection and what can enhance it.
It’s about how we were brought up and how that has a bearing on how we
parent, about the mistakes we’ll make – especially those we never wanted to
make – and what to do about them.
You will not find many tips, tricks or parenting hacks in this book, and at
times it may upset you, make you angry or even make you a better parent.
I wrote the book I wish I had read as a new parent, and I really wish my
parents had read it.
Introduction
Recently, I watched a stand-up routine by the comedian Michael McIntyre in
which he said there are four things we need to do with our children: get them
dressed, feed them, wash them and put them to bed. He said before he had his
children he had a fantasy that being a parent would be all running through
meadows and eating picnics, but the reality was that each day was an ongoing
battle getting them to do just these four basic things. There was much
laughter from the audience as he described persuading them to have their hair
washed, to put on a coat, to go outside or to eat a vegetable. It was the
laughter of parents, maybe parents like us, who’ve been there too. Being a
parent
fn1 can be hard work. It can be boring, dispiriting, frustrating and
taxing while at the same time being the funniest, most joyful, most lovefilled, brilliant thing you’ll ever experience.
When you’re bogged down in the minutiae of nappies, childhood illnesses,
tantrums (toddler and teenager), or when you’re doing a full day’s work and
coming home to your real work, which includes scraping banana out of
cracks in the high chair, or another letter from the headteacher summoning
you to the school, it can be hard to put being a parent in perspective. This
book is about giving you that big picture, to help you pull back, to see what
matters and what doesn’t, and what you can do to help your child be the
person they can be.
The core of parenting is the relationship you have with your child. If
people were plants, the relationship would be the soil. The relationship
supports, nurtures, allows growth – or inhibits it. Without a relationship they
can lean on, a child’s sense of their security is compromised. You want the
relationship to be a source of strength for your child – and, one day, for their
children too.
As a psychotherapist, I’ve had the experience of listening to and talking to
people who struggle with different aspects of parenting. Through my work I
have had the opportunity to look at how relationships become dysfunctional –
and what makes them work well again. The objective of this book is to share
with you what is relevant when it comes to parenting. This will include how
to work with feelings – yours and theirs – how to attune yourself to your
children so you can learn to understand them better and how to have a real
connection with them rather than getting stuck in exhausting patterns of
conflict or withdrawal.
I take the long-term view on parenting rather than a tips-and-tricks
approach. I am interested in how we can relate to our children rather than
how we can manipulate them. In this book I encourage you to look at your
own babyhood and childhood experiences so that you can pass on the good
that was done to you by your own upbringing and hold back on the less
helpful aspects of it. I’ll be looking at how we can make all our relationships
better and good for our children to grow up among. I’ll cover how our
attitudes in pregnancy can have a bearing on our future bond with our child,
and how to be with a baby, a child, an adolescent or an adult child so you can
have a relationship with them that is a source of strength to them and
satisfaction to you. And, along the way, have far fewer battles about getting
them dressed, fed, washed and put to bed.
This book is for parents who not only love their children but want to like
them too.

Part One
Y O U R PA RE N TI N G LE G A C Y
The cliché is true: children do not do what we say; they do what we do.
Before we even consider the behaviour of our children, it’s useful – essential,
even – to look at their first role models. And one of them is you.
This section is all about you, because you will be a major influence on
your child. In it, I’ll give examples of how the past can affect the present
when it comes to your relationship with your child. I will talk about how a
child can often trigger old feelings in us that we then mistakenly act on in our
dealings with them. I’ll also be looking at the importance of examining our
own inner critic so we do not pass too much of its damaging effects on to the
next generation.
The past comes back to bite us (and our children)
A child needs warmth and acceptance, physical touch, your physical
presence, love plus boundaries, understanding, play with people of all ages,
soothing experiences and a lot of your attention and your time. Oh, so that’s
simple then: the book can end here. Except it can’t, because things get in the
way. Your life can get in the way: circumstances, childcare, money, school,
work, lack of time and busyness … and this is not an exhaustive list, as you
know.
But what can get in the way more than any of this, however, is what was
given to us when we ourselves were babies and children. If we don’t look at
how we were brought up and the legacy of that, it can come back to bite us.
You might have found yourself saying something along the lines of: ‘I
opened my mouth and my mother’s words came out.’ Of course, if theirs
were words that made you feel wanted, loved and safe as a child, that would
be fine. But so often they are the words that did the opposite.
What can get in the way are things like our own lack of confidence, our
pessimism, our defences, which block our feelings, and our fear of being
overwhelmed by feelings. Or when it comes specifically to relating to our
children, it could be what irritates us about them, our expectations for them,
or our fears for them. We are but a link in a chain stretching back through
millennia and forward until who knows when.
The good news is you can learn to reshape your link, and this will improve
the life of your children and their children, and you can start now. You don’t
have to do everything that was done to you; you can ditch the things that
were unhelpful. If you are a parent or are going to be one, you can unpack
and become familiar with your childhood, examine what happened to you,
how you felt about it then, how you feel about it now, and, after having done
that unpacking and taken a good look at it all, put back only what you need.
If, when you were growing up, you were, for the most part, respected as a
unique and valuable individual, shown unconditional love, given enough
positive attention and had rewarding relationships with your family members,
you will have received a blueprint to create positive, functional relationships.
In turn, this would have shown you that you could positively contribute to
your family and to your community. If all this is true of you, then the exercise
of examining your childhood is unlikely to be too painful.
If you did not have a childhood like this – and that’s the case for a large
proportion of us – looking back on it may bring emotional discomfort. I think
it is necessary to become more self-aware around that discomfort so that we
can become more mindful of ways to stop us passing it on. So much of what
we have inherited sits just outside of our awareness. That makes it hard
sometimes to know whether we are reacting in the here and now to our
child’s behaviour or whether our responses are more rooted in our past.
I think this story will help to illustrate what I mean. It was told to me by
Tay, a loving mum and senior psychotherapist who trains other
psychotherapists. I’m mentioning both her roles to make it clear that even the
most self-aware and well-meaning of us can slip into an emotional time warp
and find ourselves reacting to our past rather than to what’s happening here in
the present. This story begins when Tay’s daughter Emily, who was nearly
seven, shouted to her that she was stuck on a climbing frame, that she needed
help to get off.
I told her to get down and, when she said she couldn’t, I suddenly felt furious. I thought
she was being ridiculous – she could easily get down herself. I shouted, ‘Get down this
minute!’
She eventually did. Then she tried to hold my hand, but I was still furious, and I said
no, and then she howled.
Once we got home and made tea together she calmed down and I wrote off the whole
thing to myself as ‘God, kids can be a pain.’
Fast-forward a week: we’re at the zoo and there’s another climbing frame. Looking at
it, I felt a flash of guilt. It obviously reminded Emily of the previous week too, because
she looked up at me almost fearfully.
I asked her if she wanted to play on it. This time, instead of sitting on a bench
looking at my phone, I stood by the frame and watched her. When she felt she’d got
stuck, she held out her arms to me for help. But this time I was more encouraging. I
said, ‘Put one foot there and the other there and grab that and you’ll be able to do it by
yourself.’ And she did.
When she had got down, she said, ‘Why didn’t you help me last time?’
I thought about it, and I said, ‘When I was little, Nana treated me like a princess and
carried me everywhere, told me to “be careful” all the time. It made me feel incapable
of doing anything for myself and I ended up with no confidence. I don’t want that to
happen to you, which is why I didn’t want to help when you asked to be lifted off the
climbing frame last week. And it reminded me of being your age, when I wasn’t
allowed to get down by myself. I was overcome with anger and I took it out on you, and
that wasn’t fair.’
Emily looked up at me and said, ‘Oh, I just thought you didn’t care.’
‘Oh no,’ I said. ‘I care, but at that moment I didn’t know that I was angry at Nana and
not at you. And I’m sorry.’
Like Tay, it’s easy to fall into making instant judgements or assumptions
about our emotional reaction without considering that it may be as much to
do with what’s being triggered in our own background as with what’s
happening now.
But when you feel anger – or any other difficult emotions, including
resentment, frustration, envy, disgust, panic, irritation, dread, fear, et cetera –
in response to something your child has done or requested, it’s a good idea to
think of it as a warning. Not a warning that your child or children are
necessarily doing anything wrong but that your own buttons are being
pressed.
Often the pattern works like this: when you react with anger or another
overly charged emotion around your child it is because it’s a way you have
learned to defend yourself from feeling what you felt at their age. Outside of
your awareness, their behaviour is threatening to trigger your own past
feelings of despair, of longing, of loneliness, jealousy or neediness. And so
you unknowingly take the easier option: rather than empathizing with what
your child is feeling, you short-circuit to being angry or frustrated or
panicked.
Sometimes the feelings from the past that are being re-triggered go back
more than one generation. My mother used to find the shrieks of children at
play irritating. I noticed that I too went into a sort of alert state when my own
child and her friends were making a noise, even though they were enjoying
themselves appropriately. I wanted to find out more, so I asked my mother
what would have happened to her if she had played noisily as a child. She
told me her father – my grandfather – had been over fifty when she was born,
he often had bad headaches and all the children had to tiptoe around the
house or they got into trouble.
Maybe you’re scared if you admit that, at times, your irritation with your
child gets the upper hand, thinking it will intensify those angry feelings or
somehow make them more real. But, in fact, naming our inconvenient
feelings to ourselves and finding an alternative narrative for them – one
where we don’t hold our children responsible – means we won’t judge our
children as being somehow at fault for having triggered them. If you can do
this, it makes you less likely to act out on that feeling at the expense of your
child. You will not always be able to trace a story that makes sense of how
you feel, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t one, and it can be helpful to hold
on to that.
One issue might be that as a child you felt that the people who loved you
perhaps didn’t always like you. They might sometimes have found you
annoying, hard work, disappointing, unimportant, exasperating, clumsy or
stupid. When you’re reminded of this by your own child’s behaviour, you are
triggered and you end up shouting or acting out whatever your default
negative behaviour is.
There’s no doubt it can feel hard, becoming a parent. Overnight, your child
becomes your most demanding priority, 24/7. Having a child may have even
made you finally realize what your own parents had to deal with, maybe to
appreciate them more, to identify with them more or to feel more compassion
for them. But you need to identify with your own child or children too. Time
spent contemplating what it may have felt like for you as a baby or a child
around the same age as your own child will help you develop empathy for
your child. That will help you understand and feel with them when they
behave in a way that triggers you into wanting to push them away.
I had a client, Oskar, who had adopted a little boy of eighteen months old.
Every time his son dropped food on the floor, or left his food, Oskar felt rage
rise up in him. I asked him what would have happened to him as a child if
he’d dropped or left food? He remembered his grandfather rapping his
knuckles with the handle of a knife then making him leave the room. After he
got back in touch with what it had felt like for him as a little boy when he
was treated like that, he found compassion for his own self as a toddler,
which in turn helped him find patience for his child.
It’s easy to assume our feelings belong with what’s happening in front of
us and are not simply a reaction to what happened in the past. As an example,
imagine you have a four-year-old child who gets a huge pile of presents on
their birthday and you sharply call them ‘spoilt’ for not sharing one of their
new toys.
What is happening here? Logically, it’s not their fault if they are the
recipient of so much stuff. You may unconsciously be assuming they are
undeserving of so many things and your irritation at that leaks out in a sharp
tone or by you unreasonably expecting them to be more mature.
If you stop to look back, to become interested in your irritation towards
them, what you might find is that your own inner four-year-old is jealous or
feels competitive. Maybe at the age of four you were told to share something
you didn’t want to share, or you simply weren’t given many things and, in
order not to feel sad for four-year-old you, you lash out at your child.
I’m reminded of the hate mail and negative social media attention anyone
in the public eye receives from anonymous sources. If you read between the
lines, what it seems to be saying more than anything is, It’s not fair that
you’re famous and I’m not. It’s not so unusual to feel jealous of our children.
If you do, you need to own it, not act out negatively towards your child
because of it. They don’t need parental trolling.
Throughout this book I have put in exercises that may help you have a
deeper understanding of what I’m talking about. If you find them unhelpful
or overwhelming, you can skip them, and perhaps come back to them when
you feel more ready.
Exercise: Where does this emotion come from?
The next time you feel anger towards your child (or any other overly charged
emotion), rather than unthinkingly responding, stop to ask yourself: Does this feeling
wholly belong to this situation and my child in the present? How am I stopping myself
seeing the situation from their standpoint?
One good way to stop yourself from reacting is to say, ‘I need some time to think
about what’s happening,’ and to use that time to calm down. Even if your child does
need some guidance, there’s not much point in doing it when you’re angry. If you give
it then, they will hear only your anger and not what you are trying to tell them.
You can do this second variation of the exercise even if you do not yet have a child.
Just notice how often you feel angry, or self-righteous, or indignant, or panicky or
perhaps ashamed, or self-loathing or disconnected. Look for patterns in your responses.
Look back to when you first felt this feeling, tracing it back to your childhood, where
you began to respond like this, and you may begin to understand to what extent this
reaction has become a habit. In other words, the response is at least as much due to it
having become a habit in you than it is to do with the situation in the present.
Rupture and repair
In an ideal world, we would catch ourselves before we ever acted out on a
feeling inappropriately. We would never shout at our child or threaten them
or make them feel bad about themselves in any way. Of course, it’s
unrealistic to think we would be able to do this every time. Look at Tay –
she’s an experienced psychotherapist and she still acted on her fury because
she thought it belonged to the present. But one thing she did do, and what we
can all learn to do, to mend the hurt is called ‘rupture and repair’. Ruptures –
those times when we misunderstand each other, where we make wrong
assumptions, where we hurt someone – are inevitable in every important,
intimate and familial relationship. It is not the rupture that is so important, it
is the repair that matters.
The way to make repairs in relationships is firstly by working to change
your responses, that is, to recognize your triggers and use that knowledge to
react in a different way. Or, if your child is old enough to understand, you
can use words and apologize, as Tay did to Emily. Even if you only realize
that you acted wrongly towards your child many moons after it happened,
you can still tell them where you got it wrong. It can mean a tremendous
amount to a child, even an adult child, when a parent makes a repair. Look at
the belief that Emily was carrying. She assumed Tay, on some level, did not
care about her. What a relief to learn her mother did care and had merely
been in a muddle.
A parent once asked me whether it was dangerous to apologize to children.
‘But don’t they need you to be right, otherwise they won’t feel secure?’ she
asked. No! What children need is for us to be real and authentic, not perfect.
Think back to your childhood: were you made to feel ‘bad’ or in the
wrong, or even responsible for your parents’ bad moods? If it happened to
you, it is all too easy to try to repair your feeling of being wrong by making
someone else feel wrong, and the victims of this are, far too often, our
children.
A child’s own instincts will tell them when we are not in tune with them or
with what’s happening and, if we pretend that we are, we will dull their
instincts. For example, if we pretend that, as adults, we are never wrong, the
result can be a child who overadapts – not only to what you say, but to what
anyone may say. Then they can become more vulnerable to people who may
not have their best interests at heart. Instinct is a major component in
confidence, competence and intelligence, so it’s a good idea not to damage or
warp your child’s.
I met Mark when he came to a parenting workshop I was running – his
wife, Toni, had suggested he attend. At the time, their son, Toby, was nearly
two. Mark told me he and his wife had agreed not to have children but that, at
the age of forty, Toni changed her mind. After a year of trying and a year of
IVF, she got pregnant.
Considering we worked so hard in getting there, it surprises me now, looking back, how
hazy I was about what life with a baby would be like. I think I must’ve got my idea of
parenthood from watching television, when the baby is miraculously mostly asleep in a
cot and hardly ever cries.
Once Toby was born, the reality of no longer having any spontaneity and flexibility,
of the tedium of a baby, of one of us always being on baby duty around the clock,
meant I began to swing between feeling resentful or depressed or both.
Two years on, I’m still not enjoying my life. Toni and I don’t talk about anything
other than Toby and, if I try to talk about something else, it reverts to him in under a
minute. I know I’m being selfish but that doesn’t stop me feeling like I’m on a short
fuse. I don’t see myself living with Toni and Toby for much longer, to be honest.
I asked Mark to tell me about his childhood. All he could say was that he
wasn’t very interested in exploring it with me, as it had been completely
normal. As a psychotherapist, I took ‘not being interested’ as a clue he
wanted to distance himself from it. I suspected that being a parent was
triggering feelings in him that he wanted to run away from.
I asked Mark what ‘normal’ meant. He told me his dad left when he was
three and, as he grew up, his father’s visits became less and less frequent.
Mark is right: this is a normal childhood. However, that does not mean that
the disappearance of his father didn’t matter to him.
I asked Mark how he’d felt about his father’s desertion, and he couldn’t
remember. I suggested it was perhaps too painful to remember. And perhaps
it felt easier to be like his own dad and to leave Toni and Toby because then
he didn’t have to unlock his own box of difficult emotions. I told him I
thought it was important that he did indeed unlock and open it because,
otherwise, he wouldn’t be sensitive to the needs of his own son and would
pass down to Toby what had been passed down to him. I wasn’t sure from his
response if he heard what I was actually saying.
I didn’t see Mark until six months later, at a different workshop. He told
me he’d been feeling depressed and, rather than just dismissing it, he’d
decided to start having therapy. To his surprise, he told me, he found himself
crying and shouting in the therapist’s room about his own father leaving him.
Therapy helped me put the feelings where they needed to be – with the desertion of my
dad, rather than thinking I just wasn’t cut out to be in this relationship or to be a parent.
I’m not saying I don’t still feel bored, or even resentful sometimes, but I know that
resentment belongs in my past. I know it’s not about Toby.
I can see the point of all the attention I give to Toby now; it’s to make him feel good,
not just now but in the future. Toni and I are filling him up with love and, hopefully,
that will mean he has love to give when he’s older, so he will feel valuable. I have no
relationship with my own father. I know Toby is getting from me what I didn’t get from
my own dad, that we are laying the foundations of a great relationship.
Seeing the point of what I’m doing has turned most of my discontent to hope and
gratitude. I feel closer to Toni again now too. Now I am more interested in and present
with Toby, it has freed Toni up to think of other things apart from him.
Mark repaired the rupture with Toby – his desire to desert him – by
looking into his own past in order to understand what was happening in the
present. Then he was able to change his attitude towards being with his son.
It was as though he could not unlock his love until he had unlocked his grief.
Repairing the past
Some time ago, a mother-to-be asked me what my one suggestion for a new
parent would be. I told her, whatever age your child is, they are liable to
remind you, on a bodily level, of the emotions you went through when you
were at a similar stage. She looked at me, a bit bemused.
A year or so later, with a toddler at her feet, that same mum told me that
she hadn’t understood what I meant at the time. But she’d remembered it and,
as she grew into her new role, it had begun to make so much sense and had
helped her to feel for her child as well. You won’t remember consciously
what it’s like to be a baby, but on other levels you will remember, and your
child will keep reminding you.
It is common for a parent to withdraw from their child at a very similar age
to when that parent’s parent became unavailable to them. Or a parent will
want to pull away emotionally when their child is the same age as they were
when they felt alone. Mark is a classic example of someone who didn’t want
to face up to the feelings his child was bringing up in him.
You might want to run away from these feelings, and from your child too,
but if you do you will pass down what was done to you. There will be plenty
of good stuff you will be passing on too – all that love you received – but
what you don’t want to pass on is your inherited fear, hate, loneliness or
resentment. There will be times when you feel unpleasant emotions towards
or around your child, just like you occasionally may towards your partner,
your parent, your friend or yourself. If you admit this, then you will be less
likely to be unthinkingly punishing them for whatever feeling they have
brought up in you.
If you find, as Mark did, that you resent family life because you feel
pushed aside, it could be because you were pushed aside as a child and not
considered in one or both of your parents’ lives. Sometimes this resentment
can feel more like boredom or a feeling of disconnection from your child.
Some parents think I’m exaggerating when I use words like ‘desertion’ and
‘resentment’. ‘I don’t resent my children,’ they say. ‘Sometimes I want to be
left alone in peace, but I love them.’ I think of desertion as a spectrum. On
the most severe end, there’s the actual desertion of physically removing
yourself from the child’s life entirely, like Mark’s father did. But I also
consider desertion to include pushing a child away when they want your
attention or not really listening to them when they are trying to, for example,
show you their painting (which is your child trying to show you, on one level,
who they really are).
This feeling of wanting to push children away, of wanting them to sleep
long and to play independently before they are ready so they don’t take up
your time, can come about when you’re trying not to feel with your child
because they’re such a painful reminder of your childhood. Because of this,
you’re unable to surrender to their needs. It’s true we may tell ourselves we
push our children away because we want more of the other areas of our lives,
such as work, friends and Netflix, but we are the grown-ups here. We know
that this needy stage is just that, a stage, whereas our work, friends and other
leisure pursuits can be picked up when this small person does not need us so
much.
It is hard to face up to this, to stop how we ourselves were treated being
passed on to another generation. We need to notice how we feel, then reflect
on that, rather than react to any feelings we don’t properly understand. Facing
up to the less acceptable ways we might want to act – in Mark’s case, for
example, running away – can also bring up feelings of shame. When this
happens there’s a tendency to get defensive so as not to feel the shame. And
if we do that, we change nothing and we pass our dysfunction on to another
generation. But shame doesn’t kill us. When we realize what is happening,
we can turn our shame into pride because we noticed how we felt compelled
to act and became aware of how we needed to change.
What really matters is being comfortable with your child, making them feel
safe and that you want to be around them. The words we use are a small part
of that; a bigger part is our warmth, our touch, our goodwill and the respect
we show them: respect for their feelings, their person, their opinions and their
interpretation of their world. In other words, we need to show the love we
feel for them when they are awake, not just when they look beautiful asleep.
If you feel yourself wanting a break from your children every hour of
every day, what you probably need is a break from the feelings they trigger in
you. To avoid being controlled by those triggers, look back at yourself as a
baby or as a child with compassion. Once you’ve been able to do that, you
will be able to identify with the need and longing your children have for you.
It is of course important to get a babysitter from time to time and to enjoy
some adult pursuit, but be aware if the feeling of wanting a break feels
particularly charged and seems to be there most of the time, then dare to
remember what it felt like when you were the same age as your child is now.
Exercise: Looking back with compassion
Ask yourself what behaviour in your child triggers the strongest negative response in
you. What happened to you as a child when you demonstrated the same behaviour?
Exercise: Message from your memories
Close your eyes and remember your very earliest memory. It may just be an image or
a feeling, or it may have a story. What is the predominant emotion in your memory?
What relevance can you trace from the memory to who you are now? How does the
memory influence how you parent? Remember: if anything comes up when you do this
exercise, for example a fear of feeling ashamed, which may now be causing you always
rigidly to cling on to being right, perhaps at the expense of your child, feel proud of
yourself for having spotted it rather than feeling like you will collapse under the shame
or defensively steering away and carrying on with the behaviour you enact in response
to that feeling.
How we talk to ourselves
As I said at the start of this section, children do what we do rather than what
we say. So, if you are in the habit of beating yourself up in your head, your
child is liable to adopt the same potentially damaging habit.
One of my earliest memories is my mother looking in the mirror and
picking fault with herself. And when, years later, I did the exact same thing in
front of my astute teenage daughter, she told me she didn’t like it when I did
this, and I listened and remembered how I hadn’t liked it either.
Our inherited patterns of being and behaving can often be found in how we
talk to ourselves, especially via our inner fault-finder. Almost all of us have
in our heads a sort of continual chatter or commentary that we are so used to
we don’t really notice what it’s saying. But this voice can be a harsh inner
critic. Maybe you tell yourself stuff like ‘That’s not for the likes of me’, or it
could be ‘You can’t trust anyone’, ‘I’m hopeless’, ‘I’m never good enough, I
should just give up’, ‘I can’t do anything right’, ‘I’m too fat’ or ‘I’m useless.’
Be careful of such inner talk because not only will it have a powerful steer on
your own life but it will also have an impact on your child’s life, influencing
them to judge themselves and others.
Apart from teaching your child to make harmful judgements, that inner
negative voice finds ways to exaggerate a low mood, knock confidence and
make us feel generally inadequate. And there’s another good reason for you
to catch how you talk to yourself: it seems that we pass on our inner voices to
our children (as well as our habits in plain sight). If you want your children to
have the capacity for happiness, the thing that may get in the way more than
many others is your self-critic.
We are formed into adults by our childhood experiences – it’s the
fundamental way in which we humans develop – but it is hard to shake off. It
can be difficult to stop this inner critical voice, but what you can do is notice
when you are doing it and give yourself a pat on the back for noticing.
Elaine is the mother of two children and works as an art-gallery assistant.
She is aware of her inner negative voice:
It’s usually about failure. That I shouldn’t try something because it won’t work … I’ll
be bad at it … I’ll embarrass myself. So I dissuade myself from doing things. Then I
criticize myself for being unadventurous and not applying myself. I tell myself I don’t
stick at things, that I’m shallow and have no real passion for or expertise in anything.
Just saying this to you now, I can hear the voice in my head saying, ‘Yeah, well, all
those things are true.’
I feel guilty when I think about who this voice may have come from, because I love
my mum very much. I have always known she loves me, always felt very loved. But
Mum is a worrier, has never felt good enough, has a lot of negativity. She is, and always
has been, hard on herself. She can never take a compliment. To ‘What a delicious
lasagne!’, she’ll reply, ‘No flavour and too much cheese.’
Somehow, she passed on this not-good-enough vibe to my sisters and me. We dwell
on our failures and use them as evidence that we’re no good and shouldn’t even bother.
Once, I got a B in French and it felt like the end of the world.
Mum does try to be positive, but it’ll be undermined with an unguarded comment. At
the final fitting for my wedding dress I came out of the changing room and Mum pursed
her lips, looked worried, and said, ‘Yes, yes, on the day, with the flowers and veil and
everything, that’ll do.’ Unwittingly, her own anxiety and insecurities can lay waste to
the people around her.
As well as having a self-torturous inner critic, Elaine said her mother also
got a lot right – and I in no way want to demonize her – but, like most of us,
it seems she may have been unaware of how she talked to herself, and
especially how her inner critic could be passed on to her children.
When you notice how you talk to yourself, it gives you more choice about
how you listen to that voice. This is how Elaine has learned to deal with her
inner critic:
I’m determined not to pass it on to my children. I do not want them to have my fear of
failing. It’s so demoralizing.
I used to argue with what the voice said, and I always lost (plus, this used up so much
energy and attention). Recently, I’ve found the best way is to not engage with the voice.
I almost treat it as I would a difficult work colleague, tell it, ‘Well, you’re entitled to
your opinion.’
I try to do the things the inner critic tells me I can’t do. I make myself override my
fears in order not to discourage my kids, to show them it’s not so bad to fail. I have
taken up painting again, despite the voice telling me to give up. Rather than judging
what I paint, I am training myself to notice what I enjoy about it and which bits of each
painting please me. An unexpected side effect of this has been more confidence, not
only about my painting but about life in general.
If we separate the content of what Elaine is doing into a process, it goes
like this:

1. First, recognize the voice.
2. Don’t engage with it or argue with it. Instead, treat it like somebody
   awkward who you can shake off if you acknowledge what they’ve said
   but without colluding with them, by thinking, for example, ‘You are
   entitled to your opinion.’
3. Expand your comfort zone. By doing the thing your inner critic says you
   can’t, you’ll find more confidence. It’s a real thing you can remember
   when self-doubt creeps in.
4. Being aware of the dangers of passing your inner critic on to your child
   will give you an extra incentive to be mindful of it.
   Exercise: Reveal your inner critic
   Keep a pencil and pad to hand and note down any self-critical thoughts you have
   throughout the day. Do you recognize these criticisms as ones you have seen others
   articulate in your past?
   Think of something you would like to achieve and the steps you would need to take
   to get there. Now notice how you talk to yourself about this thing. Are you saying
   anything to stop yourself? Does this voice remind you of anyone else?
   Good parent/bad parent: the downside of judgement
   The very fact you’re reading this means you want to be the best parent you
   can. One thing that stops this is judgement, both of yourself and of other
   people. How we judge ourselves as parents is my bugbear.
   ‘Good parent/bad parent’ labels are not helpful because they are about
   extremes. It’s impossible to be perfectly attuned to our children all the time,
   and even some good intentions can have harmful consequences. But because
   nobody wants to be labelled a ‘bad parent’, when we make mistakes (and we
   all do), wanting to avoid the label makes us pretend we haven’t made them.
   Partly due to these labels of ‘good mother’, ‘bad dad’, or vice versa,
   existing, to avoid the humiliation of being in the bad role, we get defensive
   about anything we may be doing wrong. That means we do not examine or
   look at the ways we are misattuning to our children or neglecting their
   emotional needs. We don’t look how to improve our relationships with them.
   It may also mean we hide from ourselves the things we may be doing wrong
   behind the things we do right, so we can cling to the identity of ‘good’
   mother or father.
   Parental fear of facing up to where we might be going wrong doesn’t help
   our children either. Mistakes – pretending our child’s feelings don’t matter,
   or whatever else we’ve done wrong – matter so much less when we change
   our behaviour and repair any rupture. But we cannot put anything right if it
   feels too shaming to admit our faults – and this label of ‘bad’ adds to that
   shame.
   Let’s drop ‘good’ and ‘bad’ as attributes for mothers and fathers. No one is
   wholly saint or sinner. A grumpy, honest parent (normally written off as
   ‘bad’) may be a better parent than a frustrated and resentful parent hiding
   behind a façade of syrupy sweetness. I’d go further. Just as we shouldn’t
   judge ourselves, we should try not to judge our children. It is satisfying to put
   something in a box, label it and forget about it, but it is not good for us and it
   certainly isn’t good for the person in the box. It’s not helpful to judge a child
   as bad or good, or indeed to judge them as anything, because it’s hard to
   thrive with the restriction of a label: ‘the quiet one’, ‘the clumsy one’, ‘the
   noisy one’ …
   Human beings change and grow all the time, especially small ones. It is far
   better to describe what you see and say what you appreciate rather than
   judge. So say, ‘I liked how hard you were concentrating when you did those
   sums’ rather than ‘You’re great at maths.’ Say, ‘I am impressed how much
   thought you have put into this drawing. I like how the house looks like it’s
   smiling. It makes me feel happy.’ Not ‘Lovely picture.’ Praise effort, describe
   what you see and feel and encourage your child without judging. Describing
   and finding something specific to appreciate is far more encouraging than a
   non-specific judgement of ‘Great job’ and far, far more useful than criticism.
   If a whole page of writing is nearly a completely untidy mess but the letter P
   is perfectly formed, all you need to say is, ‘I like how neatly you’ve written
   that P.’ Hopefully, next time, you’ll like another letter as well.
   Exercise: No more judging
   Instead of judging yourself on what you make and do, observe and appreciate what
   you get right instead. Notice the difference in how it makes you feel. For example,
   rather than saying or thinking something like, ‘I make great bread,’ try ‘Concentrating
   on my baking is paying off.’ Rather than ‘I’m bad at yoga,’ try instead ‘I have made a
   start at yoga and I’ve improved since last week.’ It’s not so much the words – I’m not
   totally banning ‘good’ or ‘bad’ – it’s about suspending judgement or holding our
   conclusions lightly rather than rigidly. This will do less harm to ourselves and to our
   children.
   I have started this book by looking at you rather than concentrating on your
   child because what makes a child the unique individual they are (or will be, if
   they are not yet with us) is a matchless mix of genes and environment, and
   you are a major part of your child’s environment.
   How we feel about ourselves and how much responsibility we take for how
   we react to our children are key aspects of parenting that are too often
   overlooked because it’s much easier to focus instead on our children and their
   behaviours rather than examining how they affect us and then how we in turn
   affect them. And it is not only how we respond to children that shapes their
   personality traits and character but also what they witness and feel in their
   environment.
   I hope I’ve convinced you to examine how you react to the feelings your
   children trigger in you. Be aware of how you talk to yourself. Look out for
   your inner critic. And be less judgemental – about yourself, your parenting
   and your children.

Part Two
Y O U R C H IL D ’ S E N V IR O N M E N T
A counsellor recently told me a story about working with a refugee family.
He was trying to empathize with them and to understand what it must be like
to have no permanent home. One of the children piped up, ‘Oh, we’ve got a
home, we’ve just got nowhere to put it yet.’
I was moved when I heard this remark. It sums up how the love and care
between family members can be a safety net, which is something we all need.
So, how can we take steps to ensure the relationships that make up being a
family feel like a sanctuary? This is what I will be looking at in this section:
how to build a family environment where your children will thrive.
It’s not family structure that matters, it’s how we all get
on
You and whoever you live with is your children’s environment. A large part
of how your children go on to feel about themselves and how they interact
with others will form in relationship to you and the small circle around you.
That’s your co-parent, if you have one, siblings, grandparents, paid help and
close friends.
It is important to have awareness about how we behave in these
relationships. For example, do we bring our appreciation to the people close
to us or do we dump our anger on to them? These familial relationships are
influential in determining how a child’s personality and mental health
develop. Children are individuals, but they are part of a whole system too. As
well as close family relationships, a child’s system also includes school, their
own friendships and the wider culture. It makes sense to look at that system
and do what you can to make it the best possible environment for you and for
your child. It doesn’t have to be perfect – perfect doesn’t exist.
It’s not the structure of the family that matters, which is good news if
you’re not in a nuclear family. The arrangements can be as conventional or as
unconventional as you like; parents can live apart, or together, in a commune
or a ménage à trois, they can be gay, straight or bisexual – it doesn’t matter.
Research has shown that family structure itself has little effect on children’s
cognitive or emotional development and, in fact, over 25 per cent of children
are brought up in single-parent families in the UK, with around half of these
single parents having been in a partnership at the time of the birth of their
child, and they do no better or worse than children from a more conventional
set-up, once factors such as their financial situation and parental education
are taken into consideration.
The people in a child’s life comprise that child’s world. It can be one of
richness and love but it can also be a battleground. It matters more than most
adults think that family life does not veer too far towards the battleground
end of the scale. If children are preoccupied, if they are worried about their
security, their safety and how they belong, they are not free to be curious
about the wider world. Not being curious impacts negatively upon how they
concentrate and learn.
In one survey, teenagers and parents were asked whether they agreed or
disagreed with the following statement: ‘Parents getting on well is one of the
most important factors in raising happy children.’ Seventy per cent of
teenagers agreed compared to only 33 per cent of parents.
This could be because the emotional distress children go through when
their parents’ and carers’ relationships aren’t functional isn’t visible to the
grown-ups. You may know how hard it is for you, as a parent, to look at your
child’s pain. And, therefore, it’s really hard to look at how your own actions
may have contributed to that pain.
You may feel justified in acting the way you do, or helpless at the idea of
changing your behaviour. It may feel daunting or even overwhelming for you
to look at how you interact with your co-parent and other close members of
your family, but I hope in this part of the book I can give you some ideas on
how to make improvements if you need to.
When parents aren’t together
Even if you live apart from your child’s other parent, what matters is that you
refer to them in respectful ways, that you can appreciate their good points and
not always be emphasizing their faults. I know this may seem impossible to
some people, especially after a difficult break-up. It may make it easier for
you when I tell you how important it is for a child: they see themselves as
belonging, attached to and part of each of you. If one half of the partnership
that brought them into being is often referred to as somehow being a ‘bad’
person, that is all too often internalized by the child so that they too see
themselves as a ‘bad’ person. A child can also be torn apart by the pull to be
loyal to both their parents.
So what’s the best way to negotiate a split? A child fares better afterwards
if the parents cooperate with each other and communicate well and if the
child continues to have regular close contact with both parents. If you can
manage that, your child is less likely to become depressed or aggressive. As
for the child’s relationship with their non-resident parent, this also works
better if there is clear, positive communication between the parents. If one
parent (it is often the father, but not always) drifts away after separation, the
child is more likely to suffer distress, anger, depression or low self-esteem.
That’s why it’s such a worry that, in the UK, more than a quarter of children
whose parents have split up have no further contact with their father three
years after the event.
I understand it is not always possible to get along with an ex, as this story
I’m about to share shows. Mel is mum to a six-year-old son, Noah. She had a
relationship with Noah’s father, James, for five years. They often lived in
different countries and didn’t see themselves as a committed couple, but they
enjoyed each other’s company hugely when they did get together. Mel’s story
may sound extreme, but anyone who’s had parenting disagreements with an
ex may find it useful.
When Mel got pregnant, James assumed she would have an abortion.
When she didn’t, he was furious and tried to sever their connection. Now, he
pays minimal maintenance, and only agreed to do so after the humiliating
procedure of a paternity test. He wants nothing to do with Noah.
When I have spoken to people in a similar position to James’s, they’ve told
me that they like their life as it is. They feel threatened and scared by the
possibility of it changing if they were to acknowledge the importance of a
dependant.
And yet a child – who is not an ‘it’ but a person in your life, albeit one who
is dependent on you for a couple of decades – is more than a mere catalyst for
change. If you were to look at becoming a parent selfishly, a child is in fact a
source of enrichment.
Also, a child does not cease to exist just because they are being ignored.
Sadly, some men (and women) do distance themselves from their children.
It’s as though, if they pretend they have nothing to do with them, they do not
really exist. Mel instinctively knew that she must not tell Noah his father had
let her down, even though she felt he had. If her son asks about him, she
remembers his dad’s many good qualities and talents and tells her son about
them. If, in the future, Noah’s father should ever want to re-enter his life, Mel
being positive about him will help this process. As Noah gets older and asks
more questions, it’s becoming harder for her. She is worried that her son,
when he does know the whole story, will take his father’s desertion
personally and that it might harm his self-esteem, or maybe distort how he
regards his gender, or even negatively influence his own behaviour when he
is an adult.
Because Mel is aware of these pitfalls, she can guide Noah around them
but, even so, there can be no guarantee he won’t at some stage take the fact
that his father isn’t there for him to heart. Sometimes there isn’t a prescription
to make everything okay. Mel has a lot of loving and involved family and
friends and feels they do go some way to filling in the gap for Noah where a
father would have been.
I have told you Mel’s story because it’s not always easy to conjure up a
smooth-running, cooperative relationship with an ex. And when one is
lacking, all we can do is try our best not to run down the other parent to our
child, or indeed to ourselves.
How to make pain bearable
We want to make our child’s life pain-free and worry-free. We certainly
don’t want them suffering because we were unlucky with our choice of the
person we had a relationship with, or because there is conflict in our close
relationships. But it’s impossible to protect them completely. No life is
without angst, unsolved mystery, longing and loss.
How you can make their pain bearable is to be alongside them and with
them when they feel it. You need to be present, for your child and the people
close to you; open and accepting to what they show you and what they feel.
You may not be able to fix their pain, but by being with it rather than denying
it or pushing it away, you can keep them company through it. And this kind
of attuned company makes anything more bearable. I will say more about this
in the part on feelings (see p. 51).
When parents are together
If you are caring for your child with a co-parent, the love, goodwill, caring
and respect between you will contribute to your child’s sense of security. And
yet, as anyone who’s had a child knows, it puts a strain on your relationship.
Spontaneity may be compromised, time alone with your partner or other
people you feel close to diminished, time on your own reduced or disappear
completely. Your or your partner’s relationship with sex may change, and
opportunities for sex will happen less often. Sleep patterns will be disrupted
and it is likely that you will have to manage on significantly less sleep; each
member of a couple, or of a wider extended family, may have different
parenting philosophies and the dynamics within the relationships may shift.
Your work habits will change and, if you stop paid work, that may alter how
you see yourself too. There will be an effect on your social life; there may be
less or no contact with former colleagues; some friends may seem to recede
for a while due to your preoccupation with your baby; and so on.
And this is by no means an exhaustive list. If you are in a couple, the
transition from that partnership to becoming a family takes some getting used
to. And just when you think you’ve got used to it, it changes again, as your
child and/or your family continues to grow. These changes can also
contribute to the resentment you may experience towards each other and
towards your child. By the way, it’s better to admit any resentment, even if
only to yourself. If you don’t, you are more likely to justify acting out of that
feeling rather than taking responsibility for it.
Life is never static and being able to accept, work with and embrace
change is more useful than resisting it. Thinking about how you can be
flexible may be more effective than trying to regain what was lost. This
doesn’t mean you won’t miss your old life sometimes. And it does mean you
may need to work at surrendering to your new one and embracing it.
Remember Mark on p. 19; he resented the way in which his life was turned
upside down by the change from being a couple to becoming a family of
three and he learned to accept that change by tracing the source of his
resentment to his own upbringing and finding meaning in childcare rather
than just writing it off as a boring chore. He also found that when he accepted
joint and equal responsibility for his child with his partner, this freed her up
to be more of her old self again, rather than being wholly preoccupied with
her baby.
How to argue and how not to argue
Most families argue – but it’s how you work through any conflict (or don’t)
and how it’s resolved (or not) that matters. Differences in and of themselves
do not have to damage a relationship and therefore your child’s environment.
People with successful partnerships and functional families have
disagreements and argue. That’s a fact. But when they do they continue to
respect and appreciate each other and to have their differences acknowledged
and their feelings heard.
Now let’s talk about the nuts and bolts of arguing. In any conflict, there is
the context. That is what you are arguing about. Then there is how you feel
about the conflict and how the other person feels about it. And then there is
the process, which is how you go about solving the problem.
To tackle difference, it’s important to know how you feel about the context
and to share that. The next step is to learn how the other person feels about
the context and to take their feelings into consideration. If feelings are left out
of it, both sides can get more and more heated as they play what I call ‘fact
tennis’, lobbing reasons over the net to each other, finding more and more to
hit the other person with. In this style of arguing, the aim of the conflict
becomes to win points rather than find a workable solution. Finding out about
differences and working through them is about understanding and
compromise, not about winning.
Let’s take a typical family argument, about the washing-up. The washingup is the context, then there’s how people feel about it. This is what happens
when the process becomes fact tennis:
SERVER The trouble is, if you leave the washing-up not done, the food hardens on it and
it is harder to wash off, so do it straightaway. 15–love
RESPONDER It is a better use of my time if I leave the washing-up during the day and
just do it all together once. 15 all
SERVER It is unhygienic to leave the washing-up undone. 30–15
RESPONDER Any accumulated bacteria will be killed when it is eventually washed up.
30 all
SERVER The dirty dishes attract flies. 40–30
RESPONDER It’s winter. No flies have accumulated around the dirty dishes. Deuce
And so on. When one person eventually runs out of reasons and is
therefore deemed to have ‘lost’, they do not feel loving or warm towards their
opponent. And if the ‘winner’ feels good, it’s at the expense of their partner.
Another style people use to deal with difference and conflict is what I call
‘Look, squirrel!’, or distraction. This is when, instead of talking about what is
bothering you or someone else, you change the subject. So you see that the
washing-up has not been done but, rather than address that problem, you say
or do something else. This may be fine – it may be appropriate to delay
talking about something – but it is not okay to avoid discussing differences
altogether. If all conflict is avoided, what tends to happen is that intimacy is
avoided as well, because when too many subjects become taboo, politely
skirting around each other can make things lonely.
A third arguing style is being a martyr. This is when you say, as you arrive
home, ‘Don’t worry about the washing-up, I’ll do it.’ Unfortunately, what
tends to happen in situations like this is that the martyr, rather than making
everyone feel guilty, eventually becomes resentful and blames other people,
or becomes a persecutor (see below) and starts flinging insults.
The persecutor attacks: ‘You’re a real pig for not doing the washing-up.
Your hygiene standards are disgusting.’ If you are on the other end of that
comment, you feel like attacking back.
None of these four kinds of conflict makes for a great atmosphere in a
family home. Conflict puts children on alert, threatens their sense of security
and leaves them less able to be open and curious about the world. Instead,
their energy and focus are switched into a sort of emergency mode.
What, then, is the ideal way to argue? When working through a difference,
work with one issue at a time and think about what the argument is really
about. Don’t save up your grouches and pour them out on to the other person
at once. Start with how the issue makes you feel, not with an attack or by
blaming. So, back to the washing-up …
‘I feel fed up when I come home after having washed up in the morning to
see more of it. What would really make me feel better would be if you
washed up your stuff during the day.’
The ideal style isn’t about winning, it is about understanding. An answer
might come back: ‘Oh, sorry, darling, I don’t want you to feel bad. I had so
much work on. I can see it’s not a great sight to come home to.’ And the
response to it might be: ‘Yeah, you do have a lot on. Never mind. How about
you wash and I’ll dry?’
A good rule of thumb when arguing is to do it with ‘I-statements’, not
‘you-statements’, for example, ‘I feel hurt when you don’t answer me when
you’re on your phone’, not ‘You’re always ignoring me when you’re on your
phone.’ Few of us like to be defined or pigeon-holed – especially negatively
– by someone else. If you instead describe how what you hear or see makes
you feel, then you are talking about yourself, which is far easier for the other
person to hear.
Of course, no way of voicing a complaint is guaranteed to ‘work’, that is,
ensure that you get what you want. But good relating is not about
manipulation, it is about having good relationships. Being open about what
you feel and what you want can help you to have good relationships, whereas
manipulating someone doesn’t make for a good connection.
Speaking in I-statements, not you-statements, owning your own feelings
and finding out about and acknowledging the other person’s feelings are
usually the best ways to deal with the inevitable differences that arise in
families. It will also help your child feel more secure, as it reduces
resentments and promotes understanding. They will also be more likely to
adopt this respectful and emotionally intelligent argument style themselves,
having had it as their example.
One reason disagreements arise in the first place is when one person thinks
they’ve been attacked on purpose when they haven’t. This example happened
in a typical family. (I’ll call them the Heritage family.)
Jonny, a twenty-two-year-old student, is inspecting his dad’s old leather jacket. He says,
‘You’re sixty, Dad, you’re never going to wear this again. Can I have it?’
Keith, a teacher, has had a bad day of not understanding his son’s generation at work,
so is feeling old. And Jonny has hit a nerve. Keith raises his voice and says, ‘What,
can’t you even wait for me to be dead before you start eyeing up my possessions?’
Jonny feels like this has come out of nowhere, and now he feels attacked. ‘Blimey, I
only asked. Why are you always having a go at me?’
‘I’m not having a go at you, but I don’t like being treated as though I’m already
dead.’
This isn’t a serious dispute, and I’m pretty certain that Keith will end it by
throwing Jonny his jacket and saying, ‘You have it, then,’ and Jonny saying,
‘I don’t want it now. You’ll need something to wear in your coffin,’ and
they’ll both laugh themselves into a truce. But if they don’t understand what
went on, they’ll both still feel a bit hurt and something similar is liable to
happen again.
So, let’s see what was really going on by pretending there is a wise
mediator there with them.
‘He wants me dead,’ says Keith.
‘No, I don’t, I want his jacket,’ says Jonny.
‘Same thing,’ says Keith, realizing at the same time it is not the same thing.
The mediator says, ‘It’s not the same thing but, today, for you, Keith, it feels like the
same thing – and Jonny has no reason to know that. You, Keith, felt attacked. As Jonny
didn’t realize that you felt attacked, he felt what you saw as your retaliation came from
nowhere, so he counter-attacked.’
‘That’s certainly true for me,’ Jonny says.
Keith is quiet, so the mediator says to him, ‘Just because you felt attacked, it doesn’t
mean you were attacked.’
‘He called me sixty!’ Keith defensively replies.
Mediator: ‘Yes, he was hiding his feelings behind a fact, a habit he has picked up
from all the “fact tennis” he’s been witness to since he was born. Moving on, it seems
you find being sixty hard to come to terms with. So you’d quite like to cling to symbols
of your youth, like that leather jacket. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t, and you
can say so if it’s true.’
A new version of the conversation might sound like this:
‘I love your leather jacket. Can I have it?’
‘I need some time to think about that … I can see you really want it, but I’m not
ready to let the jacket go. It’s true, I may never wear it again, but I need time to get used
to the idea of being as old as I am. And, in the meantime, clinging on to my youthful
clothes is a comfort to me.’
‘Sorry, my asking reminded you of being sixty.’
‘Oh, don’t worry, I need reminding. I’m feeling a bit old because I don’t understand
what some of my students are going on about.’
‘Like what?’
‘I’ve just got my head around what social media is, but what do they mean when they
say “swipe left” at me?’
‘Here, let me show you …’
Exercise: Unpack an argument
Think about the last disagreement you had with a loved one. Without getting caught
up in who was right or who was wrong, unpack what happened like I did in the example
between Jonny and Keith. Then, again as I did in that example, take a meta perspective
to see the situation and work out the feelings of each protagonist. Then play the role of a
wise mediator and think about how to change the dialogue in the disagreement and how
it could have gone better.
Here is a quick recap list of what to remember when you’re talking about a difficult
subject or when you’re getting annoyed or think that an argument is imminent:

1. Acknowledge your feelings and consider the other person’s feelings. That means
   not making yourself ‘right’ and the other person ‘wrong’, not making yourself
   ‘clever’ and the other person ‘stupid’. Nothing wears a relationship or a family
   down more than if the people within it insist on being the person who is right.
   Instead of thinking in terms of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, think in terms of how you
   each feel.
2. Define yourself and not the other, so speak in I-statements and not youstatements.
3. Don’t react, reflect. You don’t always have to reflect before reacting – I’m not
   advocating that you lose all spontaneity – but if you feel annoyed or angry, I
   think it is a good idea to pause and understand why. If Keith had done that in the
   example above, he would have realized that the anger he felt towards his son
   when he asked for the jacket did not belong with his son.
4. Embrace your vulnerability, rather than fearing it. In the example above, Keith
   would also have realized he was scared of growing old and he was about to mask
   that fear with anger rather than allowing himself to be vulnerable. But it is only
   by allowing our vulnerability, being open about who we are, that we can have
   close relationships.
5. Don’t assume the intent of the other person. Without assuming too much or
   projecting yourself on to the other, try to work out what they are feeling too, and
   admit it if you got it wrong. Understanding your own feelings and those of the
   person you are negotiating with is not only the cornerstone of negotiations, it is
   the foundation of functional relationships and of empathic parenting. It is never
   too late to start this way of interacting.
   When parents are able to do all this, I’ve found that improvements in patterns of relating
   to one another usually come pretty swiftly.
   Fostering goodwill
   In a couple or in a family, having the ability to consider each other’s feelings
   requires a store of goodwill. If you feel you’re running low, you need to
   bolster it up.
   So, what fosters goodwill? There seem to be two main ways to do it: (1)
   responding to bids for connection or attention, and (2) finding solace in each
   other rather than seeing the other, or others, in the family as adversaries. In
   other words, both cooperation and collaboration but not competition.
   When psychologist John Gottman and his colleague Robert Levenson set
   up what they called the Love Lab at the University of Washington in 1986,
   one of their experiments was to ask couples to talk about their relationship: to
   discuss a disagreement they had had with each other, to talk about how they
   met and a positive memory they shared.
   While the couples had these conversations they were wired up so that their
   stress levels could be measured.
   All couples appeared to be calm on the outside, however, the results of the
   stress test showed something completely different. Only some of the couples
   had in fact been calm. Others had high heart rates, sweated a lot and generally
   showed all the signs of being in fight-or-flight mode.
   But the real revelation came six years later, at the follow-up session. All
   the high-stress couples had either split up or were still together but in a
   dysfunctional relationship. Gottman called these couples the ‘Disasters’. The
   ones who had shown no stress during their initial interview he called the
   ‘Masters’.
   It appeared from the data that the Disasters each experienced the other as a
   sort of threat – more like an adversary than a friend. Gottman studied
   thousands of couples over a long period of time and found that the higher the
   couple’s stress indicators, the closer they were to being Disasters and the
   more likely they were to split up or have a dysfunctional partnership.
   So, what do these findings mean? The more you feel stressed and
   threatened in the company of your partner, the more likely you are to act in a
   hostile or cold manner towards them. The more your relationship is based on
   getting one up on them, on winning or losing, on being right, the more likely
   you are to feel hostility rather than goodwill towards your partner. It can be a
   relationship vicious circle. One-upmanship is all too common in our culture
   as a way of being together. Even advertising seems to rely for its success on
   making the target market feel superior to others; this is second only to
   making the target consumer feel sexually desirable. I’m thinking of the
   ‘dumb dad’ advertisements for cleaning products or commercials where the
   ‘prize’ for buying a product seems to be that you get to be smug, as if you
   have somehow been proven to be superior to your partner.
   Conversely, when a couple feels calm and soothed by being together, this
   makes each partner more likely to be warm and affectionate with the other.
   Gottman set up another experiment where he observed 130 couples
   socializing together in a holiday home for a day. What he discovered was that
   when couples are together they make what he refers to as ‘bids’ for
   connection. For example, if one partner is reading and says, ‘Listen to this,’
   and the other one puts down their own book ready to listen, their bid for
   connection has been satisfied. They are looking for a response, a sign of
   support or interest.
   Responding to someone’s bid meets their emotional needs. Gottman found
   that couples who were no longer together after six years (the time of the
   follow-up session) had on average only a three in ten response rate to such
   bids. These small, day-to-day interactions generate goodwill and reciprocal
   treatment, and without them our relationships cannot be sustained. So, this is
   the key to a successful partnership: be responsive and interested. And what is
   true for couples is true for all relationships, and especially for those with our
   children.
   As well as responding to requests for attention, there are other things you
   can choose to do that will foster goodwill – or the opposite. You can look for
   things to appreciate in your partner, family members and, indeed, in your
   children. Or, instead, you can scan them for their faults and mistakes. You
   can choose to express your appreciation or your criticism. I know which I
   prefer to hear. You can choose to be kind – and the good news is, kindness is
   catching. If you are unilaterally kind, research has shown that it is likely that
   your partner will catch it and pass it on.
   Tipping the scales, if they are unbalanced, from being critical to finding
   things to appreciate is not only crucial in your partnership or in your
   relationship with your family but in life as a whole. I come from a family
   where the culture was tipped slightly more towards criticism than
   appreciation, and I have had to work hard to change that. When I slip back
   into old habits, it can feel like I’m bathing myself in a toxic soup of criticism.
   Being kind is not about being a victim or being unassertive. Being kind
   does not mean you don’t share your feelings when you are angry. What it
   does mean is explaining how you feel and why but without blaming or
   insulting the other person.
   It is also important to know that just because you did not intend that your
   actions should cause a family member to be upset or irritated, it does not
   mean that those actions did not upset them. When someone feels bad in
   response to something we may have said or done, even unintentionally, it is
   important to listen and to validate how they feel rather than become
   defensive. We need to remember that we all experience the same things
   differently. No one is wrong because their experience is different from what
   ours would be. Such differences need to be respected rather than causing you
   to get into arguments as to who is having the ‘right’ experience.
   There’s lots of advice out there. Some of it will tell you not to sweat the
   small stuff in families and relationships. Others counsel the exact opposite
   and advise dealing with minor irritations before they become big. The main
   thing I believe we should aim for is understanding how the other person feels,
   even if we feel differently, and feeling for them where they’re at and,
   hopefully, being felt for in our turn. Everyone benefits from being listened to,
   understood and empathized with. Make this a priority in your family. It will
   make your family a good place for a baby to land and a good environment for
   a child to develop in.
   Exercise: Notice attention bids
   Become more aware when members of your family make a bid for your attention or
   connection and, if possible, turn towards that bid rather than turning away. This is
   whether the bid comes from your partner, your mother or your children. Relationships
   are precious, and turning towards bids is a major part of relationship maintenance.
   Although we are individuals, we are also very much part of a system and a
   product of our environment. As we have seen in this part of the book, there
   are several things we can do to help that system and environment be a healthy
   place for our children to grow.
